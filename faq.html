            <p>CxStocks is a minigame played on the Ice Poseidon subreddit.
               Ice Poseidon is a livestreamer who interacts with many people during his livestreams.
                The main people who he interacts with have stocks in this game including Ice.
                The idea of the game is when a person on the stream does something good or is liked by the community,
                 the community should buy the person's stocks so it's price increases and sell their stock when they are disliked.
                </p>
          </div>
          <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">How does the game work?</h4>
            <p>
              Each player in the game starts of with 10 stocks of each character and $10000 in their holding.
              When a player sells stock of a character, it loses its price and when a player buys stock of a character, it increases its price.
              The ratio of the price change is 1:0.1 meaning 1 stock that is brought or sold will make the price change by $0.1.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
            Example: If Ice's stock price is $100 and a player buys 1 worth of stock, Ice's stock price is now $100 + $0.1 = $100.10 <br />
            Example: If Ice's stock price is $50 and a player sells 0.5 worth of stock, Ice's stock price is now $50 - $0.05 = $49.95 <br />
            Example: If Ice's stock price is $20 and a player buys 10 worth of stock, Ice's stock price is now $20 + $1 = $21
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              When you sell your stocks, you will have increased your holding and will be able to purchase other stocks using this holding.
              A player's total value is equal to the holding and the worth of their stocks. A player's stock is worth by the quantity multiplied by the stock price.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            Example: Ice's stock price is currently $100, Brandon's stock price is currently $200<br />
            If a player has 2 Ice stocks, 1.5 Brandon stocks and $200 in holdings, <br />
            The total value of the player's portfolio is (2 * 100) + (1.5 * 200) + 200 = $700.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              The goal of the game is for a player to get the highest portfolio worth compared to other players. The highest value players will have their name shown in the leaderboards.

            <h4 class="alert-heading">How do I play?</h4>
            <p>
              The game is played by posting or replying to comments in the subreddit in ANY submission. There is a script running which is scanning new comments. These comments will trigger executions by a bot which will make buy/sell trades. Please make sure all comments are upper-case.
            </p>
            <p>You need a reddit account which is 7 days old (This is to prevent price manipulation).
              To register for the game, post a comment or reply in any post in Ice's subreddit by typing exactly <span class="highlight">!REGISTER CXSTOCKS</span>. If correctly done, you should see your portfolio in the <a href="player.html">Player page</a> by entering your reddit username.
              </p>
              <p>
                To buy a stock or sell a stock, a comment must be posted exactly in this format: <span class="highlight">!&lt;TYPE&gt; &lt;SYMBOL&gt; &lt;QUANTITY&gt;</span> <br />
                <span class="highlight">TYPE</span> can be either <span class="highlight">BUY</span> or <span class="highlight">SELL</span> <br />
                <span class="highlight">SYMBOL</span> can be any symbol associated with a stock. You can see the symbols in the <a href="stocks.html">Stocks page</a> <br />
                <span class="highlight">QUANTITY</span> is the amount of stock you want to buy or sell. The value should be a positive number and will be cut to two decimal places.

                </p>
                      <p>
                Example - To buy 1 worth of Ice stock: <span class="highlight">!BUY ICE 1</span> <br />
                Example - To sell 2.5 worth of Brandon stock: <span class="highlight">!SELL TTD 2.5</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                If a player does not have enough stocks that they can sell or does not have enough cash holdings to buy a stock, their command is ignored and nothing happens.
                 The price of the stock will be constantly changing so by the time your buy/sell comment gets processed, so the stock you are targetting, might not be the price at the time of the comment.
